Anglo-American lists are, for the most part insufferable privileging every manner of mediocre but culturally significant American film. But this list is different. Of course it's not the list I would make; lists are too subjective for that to be possible. But this list has three admirable qualities: it's self-reflective, it's cinematically cosmopolitan & historicist, and it views cinematic art as something beyond story-telling.

UgwGcdIv7Ci-VJG9er54AaABAg,"A few observations now having finished the list.

There's a podcast that goes minute by minute through the Lord of The Rings extended cut. Each episode is at least 20 minutes, some a lot longer. The films do have their small flaws but yeah, the logistical effort and how much that pays off on screen - its the peak of that type of Cinema.

I prefer A Clockwork Orange but I accept that 2001 is the better film, technically.

The Godfather is great, but again not just to be a contrarian, I like The Conversation more. If I was going to have a Gangster film on my list, Miller's Crossing is my favourite for personal reasons (I have a whole head-canon that I desperately need to ask Gabriel Byrne about should I ever meet him) and I prefer Goodfellas, it doesn't mystify the whole organised crime thing.

Spirited Away is awesome but its not even the best film by that director an only arguably just makes the top 5 of the studio. Totoro, Kaguya, Mononoke, Fireflies and maybe then Spirited away but Whisper Of The Heart, The Red Turtle, Kiki's could go ahead of it and at least one of those would for me. 

I feel like Satoshi Kon should make an appearance on anyone's top-list, even just on the basis of the editing. He did 4 basically perfect films with great art-direction, good stories, memorable characters and he put them together with masterful editing and lots of subtle visual motifs and details.

Gone With The Wind is one that I'd never have on a top list even if I actually liked it that much (haven't seen the whole thing since I was a teenager, recall it being bloated and melodramatic) for the same reason I wouldn't have any Roman Polanski films on mine, the context is sufficient that it trumps whatever objective qualities the work has. It is white nationalist agit-prop, no less than anything by Leni Riefenstahl, more dangerous even because its not seen that way by most casual viewers. Its politics were rotten at the time, and have only got worse in retrospect.",8 days ago,Kohhna Dearg,UCyi5aoFGFx_oPZ-Vzr9En_Q,1,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu8w_hw7o0YH7UsJWkWQbvuCe9dsJ5gnxMk84NHuXA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,False,1670254036.509795

It is actually one of my favorite movies, but in recent years, society has made me feel at times guilty for loving it, and has been deemed ""a bad movie"" as well as partially cancelled because of certain historical issues... I belong to the generation that started to deeply hate it, as I grew up loving it more and more, to the point of feeling bad for it, almost as a sinner. And this ""wokeness"" is spoiling every appreciation of art and cinema. I know that we must be critical about reality, but there are too many contradictions involved as the ""woke"" mindset is in fact being held by hideous, selfish and superficial people... I mean no offense, but it is hard to appreaciate such great movies like GWTW when there are people everywhere telling me that I am wrong for enjoying good cinema !

UgxAmLvrueAZnRoMjTR4AaABAg,"I think the following films can be honorable mentioned.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) from Disney during the early days of sound and color, the animated masterpiece was a landmark in the animation and filming process. It was not only an achievement in production and technical prowess, but it was also the first of Disney’s version of iconic fairytales retold through his lens. For almost a hundred years, we are still influenced by Disney's spells.

The Apu Trilogy: Pather Panchali (1955), Aparajito (1956), and Apur Sansar (1959) from Satyajit Ray followed the life of Apu from a poor childhood to a college-educated alum and reluctantly married and falls in love with a disgraced bride to be only to abandon the child they have after her death. It’s a coming-of-age story told beautifully and intimately through three sprawling films, which Marvel Cinematic Universe tried to replicate with their Tom Holland’s Spider-Man three-film arc about a boy growing up to be a man and taking responsibility for his actions.

Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022). Wait, this is a brand new film, just a baby born this year! Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have weaved an intricate tale about generational family trauma, immigration experience, and nihilism. It’s got drama, action, family, and interdimensional interference. Most importantly, it has a heart. In all the craziness and overblown gags and atrocities, the message is to be kind, then nothing matters, and we learn to do laundry and taxes. I am making a bold prediction, Everything Everywhere All At Once will be picked by The Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""",9 days ago (edited),Mangolite,UCz-R-0vUgaw6Xj29cy1xyPg,4,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu9xl6PxF0jBx16DfXN0LAHZUxvRMkaQnDCT6f8v=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,False,1670167638.723686

I wouldn’t put Godfather in my top ten. I do like the second one better. You should give that one a try. It’s a lot more exciting in the beginning.

Usually, I refrain from putting The Godfather at the top of lists because the film has become so popular, and I punished it for that reason. Until recently. 

There is something to be said for a movie that is not only technically sound, but that it also was infused into the pop culture of its time; Chosen by the people as iconic.

Ugw2LT9MAKl0Faow-ZZ4AaABAg.9j5ktvkvlk29j67Vewu4JB," @Co thinker  He may have a point, but I think you're both right... in Europe, directors were definitely considered artists much earlier than here (which showed in the work), and Kane definitely made many advances in the art-form. I assume that's why European filmmakers and audiences were really blown away by it.

IMO, it married the revolutionary elements of experimental film with the sweep and scope of a Hollywood epic, unlike any movie before - maybe even after.",11 days ago,Jimmy1982*Playlists,UC-pyyUKlXt9RpfkZ6F8f2FQ,15,https://yt3.ggpht.com/RUr4H60lIW-EvrHqxVPXG6S0R4tu_6kvuuBB46IHnnh2uUmwdarFnm_TiH8nPGRKXEa9kWkrU-w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,True,1669994850.265731
Ugw2LT9MAKl0Faow-ZZ4AaABAg.9j5ktvkvlk29j69Fw2akgt,"The narrative, non-linear structure of KANE is part of what makes it special. We take that for granted now, but films of that grand scale and sweep hadn’t done that before. Also, use of sound: all the art movements the OP listed don’t employ sound the same. 60% of a movie is its sound, and European films, at that time rarely, rivaled a Hollywood film in the audio department. “Changing the face of cinema” isn’t just the visuals, unacceptable sound will turn away viewers much faster than unacceptable images. KANE pushed deep-focus photography to new heights as well as use of dozens of VFX shots pioneered by others yet deployed in a single film — again, a first, that is also taken for granted 80 years later. As with many works of art, no one is working in a vacuum, borrowing and remixing is part of it. That’s also something KANE did head and shoulders above vast majority of European films pre1941. Also, with Welles being so young, the film probably inspired far more filmmakers to attempt to make films before 25 with such lasting gravitas. 99% fail at that; that level of impact is also rarely recognized. Yet, how important is that for the art form? 

The shadow this single film casts is, perhaps unprecedented and unable to be duplicated. A single film not an art movement (all of which I adore, btw). All this to say, KANE might not be number 1 but it should be in the running of top 3 or 5 always. 

There’s an excellent doc here on YouYube called Cinema Europa from late ‘90s, it delves into the various luminaries of European national cinemas, and you see some fantastic work from those art movements, so I’m not downplaying their greatness. However, KANE does so many thing already in the ideaspace at the top of the game AND had a bold storytelling modality.

All those movements you list were doing very different things to citizen kane, many you can't even compare for example german expressionism as far as cinema goes was almost totally a silent film thing which is almost a different medium entirely. Citizen kane's experiment with narrative would have been totally antithetical to italian neorealism or even someone like Jean Renoir (who was an influence on Welles). In other words, nothing like citizen kane had been produced in europe -  'Soviet montage theory' is ironically kind of a meme, kind of a false piece of history whereby for some reason people in the West came to regard Sergei Eisenstein as the father of rapid editing techniques as if Western film-makers like Abel Gance hadn't already being doing it for years beforehand",8 days ago (edited),Helvete_Ingres,UCmK4pCSvBtS-R9rnD9JMMsA,1,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu_2HwKtmcaig8qiInuf2xi-IXMjJ-aioGhMNPet=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,True,1670254050.273716

A story should be good, and The Godfather Parts 1 and 2 are about as good as it gets. Some of their primary ideas are related to the nature of evil in every person's soul, the importance of family, how power corrupts, and the idea of a man losing his soul to his business. 

The reason they're superior is simply because they're better crafted. From a technical side, it's among the best with masterful direction, sound design/editing, and near-unrivaled lighting. It's one of the most perfectly paced stories ever told, and there isn't a single frame that's out of place.

What's the point of anyone compiling a PERSONAL list if they're ideally all to converge on the same bunch of films/film-makers? You know historical importance is irrelevant there, right? Why click on this video and complain about not seeing the same list you've seen regurgitated with few minor variations elsewhere? Just to judge how conventionally 'correct' it is according to what the couple of film publications you consume tell you? Do you even get any personal enjoyment out of this litany of films and movements you appeal to, or have you just learned which ones 'had a huge impact on contemporary cinema'? 'something like lord of the rings' - predictable commercial = bad verging on self-parody of a letterboxd pseud there. Idk this is just the essence of philistinism to me. And this list IS largely 'canonical' (ie. conformist) to begin with, the only interesting thing I saw was the inclusion of a Peter Greenaway film, someone who is genuinely under-discussed even within 'film' circles. Imo, Melville is of no real worth whatsoever and I really think you mention him just b/c if you do a bit of reading on your 'french new wave' you'll often see him listed as an influence. However unverifiably true that may be, his films just don't do anything for me, actually les enfants terribles was legit b-a-d to me. The average 'french new wave' film is some kind of film-noir pastiche like Breathless I like the 400 Blows too I thought it was the best film on childhood until I saw Pather Panchali) but the sequels really are  bad enough to ruin Antoine Doinel forever for me. That's my opinion. Even glancing at this person's list, I can right away see they don't have much regard for silent film as they only include one and it's a very 'canonical' one (Sunrise), feels tokenistic. My own list would have more, so what? Not everyone has to like silent film. I also see no animation - some people don't even think of animation as part of 'cinema'. That's fine too.

I agree with a number of them including Citizen Kane, Old Boy and Spirited Away. Solaris by Tarkovsky would have made the list over 2001 but I would have added Dr. Strangelove. Sunshine of the Spotless Mind would have made my list as well as Waltz with Bashir which is one of the best war films I've ever seen.

Ugw8_i1ZIM5_dwDsMJt4AaABAg.9j5XTBtPbDl9jRij7_mBi1," @Tarang Nair  for what it's worth I think 2001 is unfortunately a product of it's time. The pacing can be grueling especially the space scenes. In 1969 seeing realistic looking space craft in realistic looking space would impress enough to hold the audience but feels a little pompous and dated to me now. The themes are important but the ending is opaque.  Solaris' themes are also important and they impress me more because they are more realized. Even though it's also slow, the pacing has more of a purpose that pays off at the end. It's one of the few movies I've seen that aims for the metaphysical and succeeds imo. Thanks for responding",3 days ago,honuman39,UCPuwXlrZYq_51GesmSBBKcA,0,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu_Y9j5VuGoB3ORrJJHaNtuiT-gXzCAwzMFjCg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,True,1670686055.251144
Ugw8_i1ZIM5_dwDsMJt4AaABAg.9j5XTBtPbDl9jRmBuBX3AS," @honuman39  I think that was kind of the point of 2001. It's either unbearably boring or hypnotic. It comes down to the individual viewing experience. I think the ending is supposed to be intentionally ambiguous and mysterious as it lets us fill in things and make our own theories based on everything else we see. Solaris doesn't go on the same route choosing a slightly more traditional way to explore its themes. 

But like I said earlier, both are excellent movies",3 days ago,Tarang Nair,UCuGWXU8L7QxcjC1QeQCfnVw,0,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu8FNqyZLcJ5rNvRwdoK6JDVIRfS2d_h6_uhXCrwOg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,True,1670686055.252144

No, I don't think its necessary. I'm not the one who posted a video titled: The 30 greatest films, and left the ability to comment on the video. There are modern masterpieces. Perhaps the word modern might be a bit vague for you but it doesn't mean in the last ten years. My point is just because a movie was made 50, 60, 70 years ago does not mean it is greater than movies that come long after it. Another film that is oddly missing from this list is Stalker. it is a clear masterpiece. Gone with the wind..? Godfather? really? No. This is a definitive title. And a tab bit arrogant one. Maybe it should read ""Our list of the 30 greatest films.""
