    "# Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling for YouTube Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to explore one of the richest, yet extremely messy, databases available online, YouTube comments! To be fair, working with any text data is always often messy since we have to deal with a lot of potential errors when analyzing the data such as typos, abbreviations, etc. However, there are a lot of tools and pre-trained models available online that are ready to use to help us clean, manipulate, and ultimately infer insights from YouTube comments. We are particularly interested in two type of inferences in this notebook, sentiment score of the video and topic modelling generated from the comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral. This is really helpful for content creators as this tool can serve as additional data points to their video likes/dislikes and help them determine which video should be build upon and which should be stopped. Topic modelling is another text analysis tool that content creators can utilize to find which ideas they can use for their next video. With that said, let's start by extracting YouTube comments for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normaly, developers request a key access to Google in order to be able to extract comments from YouTube. However, there several other \"unofficial\" methods we can use to do this. One of them is by using a Python module named \"youtube_comment_downloader.\" If you're interested in understanding this module in more detail, feel free to their repo [here](https://github.com/egbertbouman/youtube-comment-downloader)."

    "Now that's done, we have our data in its raw format and ready to be used. More context regarding our use case, the comments are taken from videos discussing the top n best movies of all time, of the past century, and in one particular genre: sci-fi. The motivation behind this exercise is that the author has always found it hard to find a reliable recommendation list of movies. So, why not make our own movie recommendation engine using what people say and recommend in the comment section? Moreover, ranking videos often spark a controversial debate, as these rankings are mostly generated from a subjective perspective. It might be interesting whether people agree with the ranks of each video or not.\n",

    "If we take a look at the graphs above, we can see that this model is not that confident in predicting the sentiment class as the majority of prediction score is at around 60-70%. Although, this result is expected since we are using a pre-trained model built specifically from a product review dataset. It might be worthwhile to use a pre-trained model that is based on Twitter sentiment analysis and see if we can improve the performance going forward. Also, unfortunately, the author has not gotten his hand on any labeled YouTube sentiment data. If we can get our hands on said data, we can further improve this model by feeding our new dataset and trying to improve the accuracy."

Just by looking at the texts, the author personally think that none of the texts are considered as negative. These are most likely netural comments with some hint of positivity because all of these comments are a list of movies that the commenters think are the best. Therefore, we can conclude that this pre-trained model is not suitable to predict YouTube comments' sentiment score."

To do this, we are going to label our data using the NLTK module, specifically using the Vader lexicon. The way this module work is that they have a dictionary of words with a polarity score ranging from -1 to 1. If the polarity score of a given word is above and equal to 0.05, then we classify that word as positive. If the polarity score of a given word is below and equal to -0.05, then we classify that word as negative. The rest can be classified as neutral."

As for the reason for using a Gaussian Naive Bayes instead of the other types of Naive Bayes is that we have a CountVectorizer object which contains real or continuous-valued datasets rather than categorical or discrete-valued features.

    "And there you go! It seems we can look for some recommendations if we explore topics 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Overall, BERTopic is a wonderful module that can help you solve topic modeling problems. It also works in multiple languages. There are other parameters that we can optimize further to improve our grouping capability. However, in the interest of time, and not wanting to prolong this analysis even further, we will stop here for now. It would be great to analyze a different combination of pre-trained transformer models for both sentiment analysis and topic modeling. It would also be interesting if we can create an automated movie recommendation that utilizes this data point as one of its features. "
